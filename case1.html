        		<h1>Self-serve Procurement of Complex Products</h1>
				<p>Dell Technologies sales portals are unable to see the entire product catalog, including complex, data-center offerings which limits their exposure to self-service experiences.</p>

				<h2>The Brief</h2>
				<p>Soon after joining Dell I was attached to multiple efforts around unifying a variety of disparate sales tools. These efforts span multiple teams and is developing into a multi-year effort across various internal tools and systems ranging from product definition, authoring, sales, and fulfillment services.</p>
				<p>In my short time with the company I was assigned to assist the API team with adopting a more user-centered approach to their development. During this time, the team struggled both with finding users as well as a path to a production environment to test out the API they were building. Dell’s Premier partner site provided an avenue to do just that and looking for more experience with the entirety of the Discovery & Framing process according to Pivotal Labs’ methodology (based on lean principals and the double-diamond design process), I joined the Premier team. Our goals were to vet out the API data for Dell EMC products and build a path to testing with production data.</p>
				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>Operating as a Principal Product Designer I joined the project as a member of a balance team made up of two Dell engineers paired with two Pivotal Engineers, along with a Dell Project Manager paired with a Pivotal Project Manager. I worked closely with my product management counterparts reaching out to internal Dell business stakeholders, end users, and other balance teams to identify dependencies and provide greater clarity to our executives. In the Balance Team model, designers operate as generalists, managing everything from facilitation of team exercises, to conducting research, running design studio sketching sessions, to building low- or high-resolution screen designs and prototypes. This project provided me an excellent opportunity to actively practice all of these skills with our team throughout the engagement.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We began by putting together a lean research plan based on all the things we didn’t know. We gathered existing research provided by the UX Research team that was timely and could inform our personas, reached out to subject matter experts and other members of the business and sales operations teams, and outlined a path forward to connect with the data being provided to our team.</p>
				<p>While going through the process, we soon realized that our executives in one part of the business had not provided any preparation with members of the sales, support, or product groups and they were unaware of our teams’ existence or purpose. This quickly resulted in roadblocks by way of product alignment and user recruitment that hindered our forward momentum in realizing both business and user value. In a positive turn of events, we were able to test out the data from the new product API micro service, however the information provided turned out to non-production data. Based on our eventual user and business stakeholder interviews, this was only a small portion of the information needed to properly support Dell and Dell EMC’s complex, data-center products.</p>
				<p>My team was ultimately able to move forward albeit slowly to connect with various members of the business and identify some stakeholders, but we were unable to secure their time until multiple days had passed. As such, we were also able to discover they typically outsource end-user contact by way of surveys and have little 1-on-1 contact with their customers. This in turn slowed down our user recruitment and we ultimately resorted to personal contacts I had made with various IT organizations throughout my career. These would eventually lead to us conducting user interviews and discovering several key insights around how they procure storage, in-house team expertise for configuring complex products, reliance on Dell’s high-touch sales staff due to discount pricing, and ultimately that the viability of a self-service option would unlikely provide value.</p>
				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<p>In hindsight, we realized that additional prep work would have created much greater willingness to partner outside of the IT organization interests and we have fed this information back to leadership. We were able to provide these insights back to the executive team and have pivoted in a new direction based on the findings we uncovered. Having clear KPIs/OKRs aligned with the business’ quarterly goals has been incredibly helpful despite our initial executives having minimal interest in developing this partnership. As part of our digital transformation efforts, we understand there are many learning opportunities for the entire organization not only on a technology, process, and delivery level, but also around cultural growth and values alignment as well.</p>
				<p>All that said, we still learned a great deal about operating as a balance team. I had the opportunity to use Figma for creating high-fidelity screens in the absence of Sketch on the Windows platform. I also was able to explore using UserTesting.com as a resource for recruitment, using their user screening tools, and although we weren't able to leverage the tool for our purposes we were able to use Zoom for hosting interviews and screen sharing. I’ve also begun working closely with our DesignOps team to create materials that can better facilitate the kinds of partnerships we will need to help other teams be more successful moving forward.</p>
