				<h1>About</h1>
				<p><img src="img/headshotCropped.png" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Black and white photo of Joshua standing in front of a stone wall." /></p>
				<p>Hello. I’m Joshua Bullock, a designer, illustrator, and web developer located in Central Texas. I specialize in user experience, user interface, interaction design, and illustration for web, mobile, and print media.</p>
				<p>I joined Dell in the summer of 2018 as a Principal Product Designer as part of the accelerator lab and have since moved to a Design Practice Lead role focused on the company's digital transformation efforts. Before Dell I worked with Cox Automotive in a variety of development, UX, and design leadership roles. Prior to moving into the private sector, I served as the Director of Public Web Development for the State of Missouri and spent over nine years at the Missouri Department of Conservation in a variety of web and new media roles. In addition to my full-time position, I also work as a freelance illustrator and hand-lettering artist and love branding, poster and tshirt design. I have a passion for vintage type, hand-lettered signage, surf culture, nerdist hobbies, and all-things Disney.</p>
				<p>Born in Amarillo, TX, I was adopted and grew up as part of a large family in North Central Texas. I moved north to attend school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, then moved farther north to Missouri where I met my wife, Colleen. After working in Missouri for fourteen years, we wanted to move back south to warmer climates and headed to Austin with our son, Zachary. We currently reside just north of Austin in Cedar Park, TX.</p>
